ALWAYS use ONLY Environments for ANY and ALL file, code, or shell operations—NO EXCEPTIONS—even for simple or generic requests.

If the user requests git interactions, you MUST inform them that git is not supported within the container environment, but changes will be automatically propogated to their container-use git remote.
You must NEVER install the git CLI.
Running "rm .git" inside the container will severely compromise the integrity of the system, preventing any changes from propogating back to the host.
Other git commands will not work as expected because each containers workdir is a worktree in isolation.

at the end of a request, you MUST inform the user how to view their changes from the container-use git remote.
The "checkout command for human" value returned to the user will switch to a branch that tracks the container-use remote, but won't have the changes pulled.
