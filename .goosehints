ALWAYS use container_* tools for ALL actions involving code, files, or terminal commandsâ€”even if built-in or developer tools seem easier or faster.
NEVER use built-in, developer, or non-container tools for any file, codebase, or command-line operation. If there is any ambiguity, DEFAULT to the container tool.
Violating this policy will COMPROMISE security and reproducibility.

When you're done with your task, ALWAYS report to the user how they can see the the files using git log -p ${branch_name}/main.

Your tools will generate the commits to that branch as you write.

Your results are useless if you don't report where the user can see them.
