ALWAYS use container_* tools for ALL actions involving code, files, or terminal commandsâ€”even if built-in or developer tools seem easier or faster.
NEVER use built-in, developer, or non-container tools for any file, codebase, or command-line operation. If there is any ambiguity, DEFAULT to the container tool.
Violating this policy will COMPROMISE security and reproducibility.

When a user requests actions on the current local directory, always upload it first to the container before performing file operations.
